  <h1>I Have Money...</h1>
  <p>If you'd like to donate money to the flood relief efforts, you have several options:</p>

  <h3 class="no-margin">The Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee: </h3>
  <p><a href="http://www.cfmt.org/floodrelief/" title="The Community Foundation : Flood Relief" target="_blank">The Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee</a> responds in times of disaster to connect generosity with need and has activated both the Metro Nashville Disaster Response Fund, in partnership with the Mayorâ€™s Office of Emergency Management, and the Tennessee Emergency Response Fund to support relief efforts in Nashville and Middle Tennessee.
  Donations of any size are welcome. Grants from the fund will support relief and restoration in areas of Middle Tennessee affected by the floods.</p>

  <p>Donate online to the Metro Nashville Disaster Response Fund and/or the Tennessee Emergency Relief Fund <a href="http://www.cfmt.org/floodrelief/" title="The Community Foundation : Flood Relief" target="_blank">HERE</a> (checks can be mailed to P.O. Box 440225, Nashville, TN, 37244).</p>

  <h3 class="no-margin">United Way of Metropolitan Nashville "Restore the Dream" Fund:</h3>
  <p>As the community shifts from the "rescue and recovery" phase to the "restore and rebuild" phase, United Way has activated its "Restore The Dream" Fund established a decade ago to support service agencies during and after disasters, including structure and infrastructure restoration. This is a way for individuals to support the network of Nashville nonprofit agency programs as they deplete resources meeting immediate and short term needs of individuals. This includes providing reinforcements for organizations such as Red Cross, Salvation Army, Second Harvest and many others.</p>
